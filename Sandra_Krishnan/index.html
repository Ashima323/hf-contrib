    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
    <br></br>
    <P>I am a Second Year BCA studying student at Kristu Jyoti College of Management And Technology Changanaserry . My ambition is to take specialization in the field of computer science.

        Meanwhile in between my studies i tried to focus mainly on designing and i was able to explore and study more about the designing.Currently i am also focussing on the programming languages such as python and javascipt .
        Web Designing is one of my interesting areas of coding especially using HTML and CSS. Few days back i also had an attempt in Internet of Things(IOT) which i completed successfully.
        Currently pursing a bootcamp in flutter.
        
        Apart from this tech related areas i also concentrate on Drawing,Painting, Art and Craft, teaching
        and Cooking .
        As a student i am having the leadership quality and also like to share with others the knowledge that i gained to inspire others in their life. I also like to explore about the new things related to computer science and grab information about the content from any source.
        I am more interested in learning mathemathics , its simple tricks and methods.As a student i like to do team work which gives me a nice experience and helped me to learn more things from it.</P>
